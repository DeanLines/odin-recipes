    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.</li>
        <p><li>For the ragu, heat a large frying pan until hot and add the oil. Cook the mince until browned all over. 
            <br>Remove from the heat and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <p><li>Add the onion, celery (if using) and garlic to the pan and cook until softened. Return the meat to the pan and stir in the flour. 
            <br>Add the stock and bring to the boil. Add the redcurrant jelly (or sugar), tomato purée and thyme, then stir well.</li>
        <p><li>Stir in the tinned tomatoes. Bring to the boil again, cover and simmer in the oven for 1–½ hours, or until the beef is tender.</li>
        <p><li>For the white sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the flour and cook over the heat for one minute. Gradually whisk in the hot milk, 
            <br>whisking until thickened. Add the Dijon mustard and parmesan cheese and season well with salt and pepper.</li>
        <p><li>For the lasagne, put one third of the meat sauce in the base of a 2.3 litre/4 pint shallow ovenproof dish. 
            <br>Spoon one third of the white sauce on top. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange one layer of lasagne sheets on top.</li>
        <p><li>Spoon half of the remaining meat sauce on top and then half of the white sauce. Season with salt and pepper. 
            <br>Put another layer of lasagne sheets on top, then the remaining meat sauce and remaining white sauce. Sprinkle over the cheddar.</li>
        <p><li>Cover and place in the fridge for 6 hours before cooking so that the pasta can start to soften.</li>
        <p><li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
        <p><li>Cook in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes – or until golden brown on top, bubbling around the edges and the pasta is soft.</li>

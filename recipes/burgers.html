    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The method of ‘smashing’ burgers creates the ultimate meaty crust. 
        <br>Serve in a burger bun with lettuce, gherkin, tomatoes and your favourite sauces</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 burger buns</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
            <li>500g steak mince</li>
            <li>4 slices mild cheddar</li>
            <li>1 red onion</li>
            <li>handful of iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 large gherkin</li>
            <li>mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>

            <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice the burger buns in half, then toast or grill the cut sides and set aside. 
                    <br>Heat the oven to 100C/80C fan/gas ¼.</li>
                    <li>Divide the mince into four loose piles and season generously with salt. 
                        <br>Heat ¼ tbsp oil in a heavy frying pan or skillet over a high heat and put one of the piles in the pan. 
                        <br>Working quickly, cover with a square of baking parchment and use a second smaller pan to press the beef patty down as hard as you can (you may wear oven gloves or use the end of a rolling pin for pressing down, 
                        <br>being careful of the heat and rising steam). Allow to cook for 2 mins.</li>
                        <li>Remove the parchment and turn the patty over. Press down with a spatula, cover with a slice of cheese and cook for 1 min. 
                            <br>Transfer to a baking tray and keep warm in the oven while you cook the other burgers in the same way.</li>
                            <li>To assemble the burger, scatter a bun base with onion, lettuce and tomato slices, followed by a smashed patty, gherkin slices and the bun top. 
                                <br>Serve with your chosen sauces on the side.</li>
